    <h1>Welcome to SkipSearch!<h1>
    <p>
      Most times search engines are 100% certain what URL you want to reach. Still, they take you to the search results, making you jump though an extra click. With SkipSearch, when we're ~100% certain what site you're aiming for we'll skip the results and take you straight to the site!
    </p>
    <p>
      To add SkipSearch on Firefox you should now see a (+) icon next to the spyglass icon. Add SkipSearch, and set it as default.
    </p>
    <p>
      To add SkipSeach in Chome, click the hambuger menu -> Settings -> Manage Search Engines, then click "Make default" for SkipSearch listed under "Other search engines"
    </p>
    <p>
      Since this is just a short proof of concept, the only search terms that will skip immediately are "nrk", "cnn" and "mozilla".
