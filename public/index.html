    <p>
      Most times when searching for something without specifying the entire URL search engines are 100% certain what URL you want to reach. Still, they take you to the search results, make you jump thoughan extra click. With SkipSearch, when we're ~100% certain of what site you're reaching we'll skip the results and take you straight to the site!
